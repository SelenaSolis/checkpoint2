                Albert and Nicole are avid hikers and animal lovers. They opened Purrrrfect Cuts 
                when they realized that their love for cats and need for a job that allowed for travel 
                could be combined in a business in a much needed market. Pampering Pets. They have owned
                several cats in the 10 years they have been married. Many of which are featured on the 
                site. They have dedicated their lives to making sure all their pets are pampered and 
                presentable, so why not provide this service for others' pets? Purrrrfect Cuts has been
                featured on many websites and Albert and Nicole have been asked to attend the 2019
                International Cat Show to provide some last minute pet grooming and relaxation for the 
                contestants.
